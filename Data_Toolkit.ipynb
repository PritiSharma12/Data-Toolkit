        "\n",
        "   - NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library used for numerical computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these data structures efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Why is NumPy Widely Used in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "     Efficient Array Computation: NumPy's arrays (ndarray) are more   memory-efficient and faster than Python lists for numerical operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Vectorization: NumPy eliminates the need for explicit loops in many cases by applying operations to entire arrays at once, improving performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Broadcasting: It allows operations on arrays of different shapes without the need for explicit reshaping.\n",
